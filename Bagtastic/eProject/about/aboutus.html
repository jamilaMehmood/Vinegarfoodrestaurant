professional acrobatic dancers.  In their performances Bagtastic utilise elements of pre-recorded material to create the big sound of a full Celtic rock band but without the stress of a stage full of equipment. This makes them the ideal size to perform as the ‘featured act’ at awards ceremonies and other events where stage space is at a premium. From a three piece act to a stage full of musicians, Bagtastic can provide a bespoke show, tailored to suit the needs of your event. In the case of weddings, in addition to their normal set, Bagtastic pipers can also do all meet and greet and top table pipe-ins with the “G-Man”  taking care of DJing and Ceilidh dance calling to ensure an enjoyable and unforgettable complete package of high quality entertainment for all.
